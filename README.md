# KiraServices_App
ALU Foundations Project<br>
<p>Kira aims to enhance healthcare services in Rwanda by developing and launching a website called Kira Services. The website will provide information about nearby hospitals and medical facilities, enabling patients to compare and choose the most suitable option.

### MERN Stack Technology:
The Kira Web App is built using the MERN stack, which includes the following technologies:
* MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the database management system to store data related to users, hospitals, appointments, and services.
* Express.js: Express.js is the backend web framework for server-side operations, routing, and API handling.
* React.js: React.js is the frontend library to build a dynamic and interactive user interface. It allows seamless handling of components and state management.
* Node.js: Node.js serves as the server-side JavaScript runtime environment, enabling the execution of JavaScript code on the server and handling requests from the client.
